Deployment Needs to support:

Initial Deployment
Update Deployment
Disaster recovery deployment
Add a DB Server
Small Deployments (no recreating all the web servers)
Upgrade Memory
Add a web server
Add a memcached server

Automated deployments:
Cloudwatch - says load too high, automatically add a server
Disaster recovery deployment - Check DB server, if not
  - recreate from latest snapshot
Check for Memcached server, if not - 
  - launch a new memcached server
Check for Web servers, if not -
  - launch new web server

Example initial deployment:
1. Launch RDS master server
2. Launch RDS backup server
3. Wait until master server is operating
4. Add users to master server
5. Launch memcached server
6. Run DB migration

Example Update deployment:
1. Create a whole bunch of new web servers
2. Configure all the new servers
3. Wait until all the servers are in a solid state
4. E-mail the admin to check the servers
5. Wait for an "Update Load Balancer" button push from admin
6. Update the load balancer to the new servers
7. Email the admin to check the new deployment
8. Wait for a "Remove the old servers" button push from admin
9. Teardown the old servers

Example partial update deployment:
